Team,

Unfortuntately I am unable to submit anythig substantial for this assignment and am asking for the lowest grade possible. I pinged Alan in Slack about it (quite last mnute so he was likely unabble to see it) but I more or less have been working 16 hour days for the past 3 weeks and have suffered in class as a result. I've bene working on getting back up to speed and have been waking up before my typuical 5 am starts working on what we have learned, but I am more or less begging to just remain in the class. I am so sorry to put either of you in this position, but here I am sadly. Please know that this will not be the case again for anything going forward.

Nick
